# How to install Github Nuget Package

This is a readme file to understand how to install Github nuget packages.

## How to Authenticate.
To download a NuGet package from GitHub Packages, you need to configure your NuGet client to use the GitHub Packages source and provide authentication. Here's how to do that:

1. **Configure the NuGet client with your GitHub Packages feed**: You need to add the GitHub Packages feed to your NuGet configuration. This is usually done by adding a nuget.config file to your solution directory or modifying the global NuGet configuration on your machine.

2. **Authenticate with GitHub Packages**: You need to authenticate your NuGet client with GitHub by providing either a personal access token (PAT) with at least ***'read:packages'*** scope or using the **GITHUB_TOKEN** if you are fetching packages as part of a GitHub Actions workflow.

Here are the steps to configure NuGet to work with GitHub Packages:


## Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)


1. Go to your GitHub settings.

2. Under "Developer settings," click on "Personal access tokens."
Click "Generate new token."

3. Give your token a name, select the ***'read:packages'*** scope to download packages.

4. Click **"Generate token"** and copy the generated token immediately as you won't be able to see it again.

## Step 2: Add the GitHub Packages source to your NuGet configuration

Create a ***'nuget.config'*** file in your solution directory with the following content:



```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="github" value="https://nuget.pkg.github.com/FOA-FunctiOnAir/index.json" />
  </packageSources>

  <packageSourceCredentials>
    <github>
      <add key="Username" value="GITHUB_USERNAME" />
      <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="GITHUB_TOKEN" />
    </github>
  </packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```
Replace **GITHUB_USERNAME** with your GitHub username, and **GITHUB_TOKEN** with the personal access token you created.

## Step 3: Downloading the Package

Once your nuget.config is configured, you can download the package using the dotnet CLI or the NuGet CLI:

```sh
dotnet add package BiUM.Core --source "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/FOA-FunctiOnAir/index.json" --project .\PROJECT_PATH\
```

**Note**: If you're using this configuration on a build server or any kind of automation, make sure you protect your personal access token. If you are doing this as part of a GitHub Actions workflow, you can use the GITHUB_TOKEN instead of a PAT for authentication within the workflow.
